# Latex-Styles
My collection of style files for latex things :)

## Styles available:
### Netlogo Listings
Adding this style file to your latex library will let you create listings of NetLogo code that make the code appear exactly as it would in the editor.
Usage:

\usepackage{listings}\
\usepackage{xcolor}\
\usepackage[lighttt]{lmodern}\
\usepackage{NetLogo}
